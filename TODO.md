# TODO: Fix CORS and Backend Access for Deployed Frontend

## Steps to Complete:
- [ ] Restart the backend server to apply latest CORS configuration
- [ ] Install ngrok for exposing local backend publicly
- [ ] Start ngrok tunnel on port 3001
- [ ] Update frontend VITE_BACKEND_URL to use ngrok public URL
- [ ] Test connection from deployed frontend to public backend URL
- [ ] Verify CORS headers are properly set for the origin

## Notes:
- Backend code already includes 'https://my-html-react-vibe.lovable.app' in allowed origins
- Localhost access from deployed site requires public exposure of backend
- Ngrok provides secure tunnel for testing
